This code reads an image file (`denoised_image.jpg`) using OpenCV and then defines a function `find_path` that searches for a path through a grid. The grid is represented as a 2D NumPy array where `1` represents a valid path and `0` represents an obstacle.

The `find_path` function uses backtracking to find a path from the top-left corner of the grid to the bottom-right corner, avoiding obstacles. If a path is found, it returns a list of coordinates representing the path. Otherwise, it returns `None`.

Next, the code creates an example grid and uses the `find_path` function to find a path through it. If a path is found, it prints the path coordinates.

Then, the code calculates a value `z` based on the height and width of the image and uses this value to transform the path coordinates. The transformed coordinates are then used to draw green circles at those points on the image.

Finally, the code converts the image from BGR to RGB format (for compatibility with Matplotlib) and displays the image with the marked path using Matplotlib.

In simple terms, the code reads an image and finds a path through a grid, then marks the path on the image and displays it.
